## Overview
For this project, our group is creating an online book store where users can buy books that are available and are in stock 
and owners can add and remove the books from the book store. Using Java Spring Boot, AJAX, and deployment tools like
Microsoft Azure, we are able to create a web application that portrays our project idea.

## Milestone 1 (November 13, 2023):
In this milestone, we are currently building a prototype of our project. The main goals were the following:
  - Having a functioning project
  - Deploy the application using AWS
  - Have a functioning UI using HTML and AJAX

# Additions for Future Milestones:
  - Adding a checkout feature for users
  - Deploying the project using AWS
